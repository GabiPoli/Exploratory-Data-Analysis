Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Election 2016 - This Repository contains the project related to data collecting, cleaning, visualization and analysis

In this project I will analyze the results of political polls and answer some questions:

Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?

Did the poll results favor Trump or Clinton?

How do undecided voters effect the poll?

Can we account for the undecided voters?

How did voter sentiment change over time?

Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?
