Hi there,

On this data analysis repository I will process some investigations using the main pillars of EDA, including data preparation, data exploration and dada visualization. I have also included a simple pdf, created with python language. 

I'll be answering the following questions along the way:

1. Is there any correlation between the variables?

2. What is the genre distribution?

3. What is the user rating distribution?

4. What is the user rating distribution by genre?

5. What is the price distribution by genre over the years?

6. What is the rate distribution by genre over the years?

7. What is the review distribution by year and genre?
